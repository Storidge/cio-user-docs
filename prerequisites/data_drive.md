# Data Drive

During installation, CIO will automatically discover and aggregate drives from each node into a shared storage pool. A minimum of three drives per node is required to ensure data redundancy. CIO will only add raw devices to the storage pool, i.e. drives formatted with a file system or partitioned will not be added. Delete the partitions or clear the drive metadata as needed. 

Drives with partitions can be cleared using tools such as `fdisk`. To clear drives that are mounted, first unmount and then clear the metadata area, e.g. for device sdb:  

```dd if=/dev/zero
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=1M count=300
```

The CIO software delivers powerful but easy to use volume management across a cluster of nodes. Some of CIOâ€™s capabilities duplicate and conflict with volume management software such as LVM. Due to unpredictable results, it is highly recommended not to use two volume management software on the same drive.
