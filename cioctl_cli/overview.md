# overview

The cioctl command-line is used to manage cluster level resources, such as drives and nodes. This interface is generally used by operators unless a developer is managing their own cluster. 

Like the cio command-line, the cioctl interface comes installed. The `cioctl` command-line has many subcommands, such as `cioctl create`, `cioctl init`, `cioctl reboot`, etc.

Running `cioctl` by itself displays help showing all available subcommands. In addition, you can run any command with the `--help` flag to output help information. For example, try running `cioctl drive --help`. This outputs a one sentence usage info and lists all options the command accepts. Details on various cio commands are available in the left navigational section of this site.
