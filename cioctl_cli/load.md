# cioctl load

<h3>Usage</h3>

`cioctl load`

Restarts cio on a single node cluster.

The `cioctl load` command restarts cio operations on a single node cluster after an online update. This command performs the reverse sequence of the `cioctl unload` command and restores previously stopped containers and services to running state.
