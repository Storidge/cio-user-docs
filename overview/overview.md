# CIO Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Storidge's Container I/O (CIO). This website aims to document different aspects of CIO including CLI commands, API specification, use cases and references. 

CIO creates a storage abstraction layer on top of a group of hosts for stateful applications to persist and share data on logical resources. The capabilities of CIO enables you to:

- easily deploy and keep running highly available containerized applications 
- run hyperconverged workloads with orchestration systems
- effortlessly ensure consistent performance after container restarts with automated data locality
- eliminate 'noisy neighbor' issues in production 
- avoid 3 am support calls through automated storage operations and recovery

If you are interested in how CIO compares with enterprise storage systems or other software defined storage solutions, refer to [CIO vs Others](https://guide.storidge.com/cio_vs_others/overview.html).

It is recommended that you start with the [Getting Started](https://guide.storidge.com) guide first, if you are just getting started with CIO. Then return to this page when you are ready for more details.
