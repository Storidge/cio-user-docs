# CIO Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Storidge's CIO. 

 - the command line utility for managing the lifecycle of virtual machines. 

This website aims to document every feature of Vagrant from top-to-bottom, covering as much detail as possible. 

If you are just getting started with CIO, it is recommended that you start with the getting started guide first, and then return to this page.


The navigation will take you through each component of Vagrant. Click on a navigation item to get started, or read more about why developers, designers, and operators choose Vagrant for their needs.
